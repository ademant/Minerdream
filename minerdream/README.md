# Minerdream_mod
[davieddoesminetest] A mod, that makes minig way more fun, and is a replacement for Xtraores, which I abandoned.

In the first step my work was mostly invisible to provide a kind of api to configure the new cool ores by a simple text file and to make the coexistence with other mods a little bit more smooth.

Beside the ores the default furnace is modified to cook only items with a cooking time less (say) 30 seconds.
Ores with a higher cooking time are smelted in a new smelter, which use clay bricks refractories to achieve higher temperatures.
This clay bricks wear out and have to renewed.
