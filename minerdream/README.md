#Minerdream
Original by 
[davieddoesminetest] A mod, that makes minig way more fun, and is a replacement for Xtraores, which I abandoned.

A nice mod, I redesigned mostly by implement a complete new kind of configuration, making it easier to define new ores. And also to override existing ores with other tiles.

Out of this a kind of API for registering new ores or extending existend ores.

##Short description
New kind of ores, marmor and gems. And tools and armor using this new ores.

##Not so short description

The definition of new ores is ... simplified, by using one spreadsheet file for configuration all kind of ores. Making it easier to adjust ores or to insert new ores.

Same is for tools and weapons. They are defined in a spreadsheet file.

With this file the new ores are registered. Existend items can be extended to use the cool tooltips, visible in unified inventory, showing main infos about tool.
